# ArabicSlidingPuzzle
This game is based on the "Standard Script" developed by Professor Bouhadjera in 1990 for writing Arabic with a detached script. This script takes into account the hamza and short vowel marks (Harakat) and allows for automated processing of the Arabic language. This digital version mimics the physical sliding puzzle.
